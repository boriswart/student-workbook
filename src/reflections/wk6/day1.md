<h1>Post hack-a-thon class presentation reflections:</h1>

Last friday I insinualted that <em>they</em> , fellow team members .... were witholding information from me with an athoritative disposition. I was accurate that this was an authoritative dissposition.. I am certain now that this was not 'keeping secrets'  as I had previously stated over the weekend but they could not tell me untill they figured things out. They were telling me to do things as they were thinking things out but they had not decided yet because thay had not gotten to the problem yet.

After I left at about 10:30 pm they had to figure things out and they did do the exporting of filtered data from mongoose to proxyState comments.  The guy with the entire project in his mind was not answering the questions because he did not know. 

So the one and only dictator coder could only and was only capable of working on the portion he was working on and could not help me but certainly capable of dictating what I was to do which of coures that was an impossible was impossible.

<h4>So what is the new learning?</h4>  The new learning is that working as a team with people that must controll every aspect of the design is impossible and a recipe for intense insane frustration.    And not worth the frustration.

<h1> Additional Reflection:</h1>
My team mates had a pre-supposed false understanding that I am an Idiot apparently.  Where I did state some idiotic ideas through out the colaboration and when I was confronted about them I realized that in some cases .... not all they were right and I was wrong..... That admission of bad thought on my part did not help in any way In fact it contributed all the more to there underlying false assumption.  If I were to talk with them now there would be no resolution because they would still be considering everything I say to be Idiocy.  <em>This coding is very difficult to deal with but the human mind is far greater a challenge than anything else....</em>

That is the final conclussion I draw.
