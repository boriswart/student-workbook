<h1>Post hack-a-thon class presentation reflections:</h1>

Last friday I insinualted that <em>they</em> , fellow team members .... were witholding information from me with an atoritative disposition. I was accurate that this was an authoritative dissposition.. I am certain now that this was not 'keeping secrets'  as I had previously stated over the weekend but they could not tell me untill they figured things out. They were telling me to do things as they were thinking things out but they had not decided yet because thay had not gotten to the problem yet.

After I left at about 10:30 pm they had to figure things out and they did do the exporting of filtered data from mongoose to proxyState comments.  The guy with the entire project in his mind was not answering the questions because he did not know. 

So the one and only dictator coder could only and was only capable of working on the portion he was working on and could not help me but certainly capable of dictating what I was to do which of coures was impossible.

<h4>So what is the new learning?</h4>  The new learning is that working as a team with people that must controll every aspect of the design is impossible and a recipe for intense insane frustration.    And not worth the frustration.
