# What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

lifecycle hooks are thrown when vue does something specific. For example when a page is loaded it is an onMounted hook. Theese can pe used to perform tasks at the same point in time.

# How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
As in the example below.. The back arrow key takes you back from car details to Cars... It is better to reload the cars ,.

# What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
use mouting hooks to draw all cars for example to the screen when the cars page reloads.  So for example if you are in car details. And you get out of there using the back arrow It would be goodv to relaod the cars without the need to push the button.
