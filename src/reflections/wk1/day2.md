# What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
A Pseudo  Class is used to define a special state of an element in CSS. Probably the most common use of this is to define the state when a mouse-over occurs of an element.

E.G 
/* mouse over link */
a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
}


What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

The pseudo class style change can make the web page more responsive to the user.


What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
