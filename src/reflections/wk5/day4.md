Daily Journal
Read Servers with Node/Express > MongoDb Relationships and answer the following questions

# What is a virtual property? 

This question is not part of MongoDb Relationships as described above. It appears that virtuals are addressed later in "Virtuals in Mongoose" So for this Daily journal I think I will pass on the question until I can  read that section. I did a cntrl-F search of the above and the word virtual is not even in the document at all. If you expect high precision from me the student ... then you should also deliver the same. Sorry not trying to be mean.

# When might you use a virtual property?

Same as above but I believe this is a link between related data that is made clearer by by a virtual naming. Have not read yet. TBD

# How do you search by a virtual properties value?

No Idea please see above TBD.
