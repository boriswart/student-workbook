# What are the three types of relationships?
    1. one to one
    1: one to many
    1. many to many

# What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding
The size of the original could get very large in the case of comment on a post where there are many comments posted over time. This would cause that data to push past original limits and need to be restructured...


# What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
 The number of many where the relationship is N: to M:  where N is a much smaller number than M: for example it might drive your choice to create sub categories say with comment to 50 max and pages of more momments each with a max number of 50 comments..

helps with pagination also..
