Read Intro to JS > JavaScript Functions and answer the following questions
What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

# What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
The parameters are the inputs of the function as defined by the function.. From their perspective they express what the function needs or is looking for. An Argument is the actual value passed into the function at run-time and gets pushed on the stack and is lost out of memory when the function returns. 

# What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A Higher order function is a function that 'works-on' another fuction. It gets a function as an argument and returns a modified function when it completes.
