Weekly Reflections (Optional)
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

I learned to debug little chunks at a time.  To avoid long debug activities.

Planning is key. What is not key is coding immediately.....

 I struggle with speed .... coding entry. debug .... etc.   I forget a lot of things so I need to look up reference material all the time. I wish I were able to write code with much greater speed and accuracy.....

I covered the week checks but it took ALL WEEKEND !!!!
 Thanksful to be apart of Codeworks.  !
