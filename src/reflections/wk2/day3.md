<h1> Read Intro to JS > Chrome Developer Tools and answer the following questions </h1>

# What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
way1. Just comments that express  you got to a certain area of code to show that you successfuly got to a certain area of your code. E.G. You caught the proper or expected input and you received it in your JS module.

use this style just to check hook up so that you can easily debug just the initial hook up between html and JS.


way2. When you create a function that passes an argument. Console log a text message expressing what argument you were looking for followed by a comma and the argument that was passed so as to be certain it gets passed in correctly and it is the type expected. E.G right location into your object.

This could save you a lot of time by thecking your input parameters are setup properly


# Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

Elements tab. When you write to the DOM... either innerText or innerHTML .t is usefule to open the Elements tab and see how the DOM is affected or if it is affected by your JS command listed above.
This can save you a lot of time to check this prior to continuing to write more JS code.

# Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Incrementally ... check everything out a little at a time before your code gets to large and and therefore more time consuming to debug....

Daily Challenge:  Put in some extra work to make this one have a nice flow.  Cut up a GIF image into all the parts that happen when one hand wins over the other. I load the gif images at the desired times and use a timer to to give time for them to be played. Later I added the running totals on THU. Fun project...
