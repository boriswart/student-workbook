What is Scope ?

# What is Hoisting ? 
Declarations in JS are 'hoisted to the top of their scope so that it is possible to use a variable even before it is declared. It is in the scope of function that it was declared but hoisted to the top of that scope even already used in the JS prior to the declaration..

# In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
'let' is or should be used in code where you need to declare a variable that can and will be updated while processing the function.

'const' is declared once in the function as the function opens but not updated while processing through the work of the function. It remains constant after declared and initialized.

'var' deprecated or being deprecated. It is still usefule because it can be re-declared without error while 'let' cannot.
