# What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?

The cause of callback hell is when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom. Lots of people make this mistake! In other languages like C, Ruby or Python there is the expectation that whatever happens on line 1 will finish before the code on line 2 starts running and so on down the file. As you will learn, JavaScript is different.

# What are callbacks?

Call backs allow code to wait for completion of  call back response.
They ase code bits that effectively wait for an asynchronous response

# What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
Asynchronous means that thinks do not occur in the expected time. Like right after you execute..... In Microelectronics everything processses to the system clock and ar latched at rising or falling edges of that clock .  Asynchronous means in that case that an input can happen anytime and not in sync with the clock. Just an aside.


# Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell

declare the function async ... use asynwait  or await on callbacks.
