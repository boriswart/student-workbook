# Promises in JavaScript

How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
A promise in JavaScript is similar to a promise in real life. When we make a promise in real life, it is a guarantee that we are going to do something in the future. Because promises can only be made for the future.

A promise has 2 possible outcomes: it will either be kept when the time comes, or it won't.

This is also the same for promises in JavaScript. When we define a promise in JavaScript, it will be resolved when the time comes, or it will get rejected.
