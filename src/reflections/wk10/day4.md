Worked on Group Capstone. Timber.

Performed updates to Account page.  Added ability to add and update cars associated with Timber Account.  Added get services to Account Authorization Services so that the List of Contacts alway shows up on the Account page once the user is logged in with AuthServices...

Added Dropdown menu to the Cars edit button so that the list of cars can be updated.  By the user in the Account page... Needed to add Server controller PUT function to update the cars.

Worked on this until 5PM and then continued to work on Artist after as a prep for the weekend the finals week comming up..

Teams works together very well..
