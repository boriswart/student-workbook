# What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

The Proxy handler has set and get. Each with checks to ensure appropriate connection to the proxy.


# What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become undefined?

Make sure that your code sense is working it will guide you to correct connections. Also make use of JS Doc which will help guide those connections.. But probably most important things is to console log you connections / links prior to coding further....make sure you can trust your connections first.



# What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Benefits are that users cannot snoop thru your code and mess with it .... They can still find your code on github so ... but that is beside the point.. If you ned privacy of it while the application they cannot mess with it.    And of course your data is protected from access....
