# Code Monkey was Awesome!

I play guitar ....  Lately a lot...

When I was working as an engineer in microelectronics I got enough creative opportunities during the course of a day that I did not feel the need to play or practice guitar much.. However I did find a communitee band in Milton Vermont and played the Trumpet.  That seemed to fullfill my desire to continue in Music....

When I became unemployed in Idaho , I started playing electric guitar again...and enjoying it a lot.  Not good though for the Husband Wife relationship so much for the husband to stay home and play electric guitar instead of looking dilligently for more work....  I found some less attractive work but alwaays felt super disrespected by colleges who probably thinking poorly about working with someone who had way more education then they...  I heard a lot of dipearaging comments about how unimportant is 'book learning' etc.

Ok so in shoert the work experience in Idaho was toxic for me.... The more over educated I was for the job, so much the worse.  

I finally decided to start thinking about software instead of hardware because I could choose a possible employer instead of being locked out by the only Microelectronics employer in the valley.....

About this time I started teaching Guitar.. I noticed that my guitar skill started really picking up... I had to think more about what I was teaching others. Cool I thought..  Now I started code works and I ma also thinking about JS and possibly teaching Guitar to a online audience using my coding skills together with guitar playing skills .... Wow now my guitar playing skills are exploding... Seems I am finding my place in the world.. Maybe not sure but it feels right.

This week I learned important skills and my guitar skill are really improving...Online guitart teacher is looming in my brain.

I love what I am learning here.!  And those are my weekly reflection.
