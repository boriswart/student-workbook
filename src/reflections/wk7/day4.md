# Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

In my capstone I implemented the router links to some degree and the reading about router links was helpful. However I was missing some key elements in my understanding which caused me to need to do much experimentation with router links.  Any little problem causes the page to unload .. A lot of experimentation was needed. I needed to go back a lot and comment most of my templat uot to find the problems and while commented out I was able to experiment a great deal.


What went well?

Experimentation...Debugging skills are improving..


What would you do differently?

wish I had done the experimentation earlier on. not wait till I was in the throw of failure.

Capstone not happening.  To many problems.. rabbit hole scoping. I am not starting to get this only until Sunday at this writng..  Working on Bug-log two strike....
