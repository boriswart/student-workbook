# What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when multiple people work on the same application. One can do the back-end while the other does the client application for example.

What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

Two sets of eyes on the same project helps to remove bugs when working together..Much faster working together.

What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Sometimes one of the pair will steamroller. Become a dictator...It happened to me. It sucks really bad so that this last week I decided in order to learn I would do the capstone all by myself. The last time I got steam rolled by authoritarian and unfortunately I did not lear what I needed to learn putting in the hole very badly.... I have had to fight my way back missing the capstone but lerning what I needed to learn.

Capstone not completed... this week.
