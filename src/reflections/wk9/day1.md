# Read Foundations of C# > C# Data Types and answer the following questions
What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
types: value, reference, and pointer.

<em>value</em> is a box that contains the value you give it.
<em>reference</em> is a box that contains the address in the computer memory of value where it is stored.
<em>pointer</em> is similarly a reference but that it is not managed for you. No garbage collection.

bool
 byte
 char
 decimal
 double
 enum
 float
 int
 long
 sbyte
 short
 struct
 uint
 ulong
 ushort


In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
